# Structuring

Certainly! Let's explore the "LIMIT" clause in SQL.

## The LIMIT Clause in SQL

### What Is the LIMIT Clause?

The "LIMIT" clause in SQL is used to restrict the number of rows returned by a query. It is particularly useful when you want to retrieve only a specific number of rows from the result set, especially when dealing with large datasets. The "LIMIT" clause is commonly used in conjunction with the "SELECT" statement.

### Syntax of the LIMIT Clause

The syntax of the "LIMIT" clause typically follows this format:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
LIMIT number_of_rows;
```

- `column1, column2, ...`: The columns you want to retrieve data from.
- `table_name`: The name of the table you are querying.
- `number_of_rows`: The maximum number of rows you want to retrieve.

### Using the LIMIT Clause

Here's an example of using the "LIMIT" clause to retrieve the first five products from a "products" table:

```sql
SELECT product_name, price
FROM products
LIMIT 5;
```

In this query, the "LIMIT" clause restricts the result set to only the first five rows.

### Benefits of the LIMIT Clause

- **Performance**: The "LIMIT" clause can improve query performance by reducing the amount of data retrieved from the database.
- **Pagination**: It is commonly used in web applications to implement pagination, allowing users to view data in manageable chunks.
- **Focused Retrieval**: The "LIMIT" clause helps you focus on a specific subset of data, making it easier to work with large datasets.

### Limitations of the LIMIT clause

- The specific syntax and behavior of the "LIMIT" clause may vary depending on the database system you are using. Some databases use different keywords like "TOP" or "ROWNUM" instead of "LIMIT."
- The order in which rows are returned when using "LIMIT" may not always be guaranteed unless you use an "ORDER BY" clause.

### Example Use Case for the LIMIT clause

Suppose you have a table of customer reviews, and you want to retrieve the first 10 reviews to display on a website:

```sql
SELECT review_text, rating
FROM customer_reviews
LIMIT 10;
```

In this example, the "LIMIT" clause ensures that only the first 10 reviews are retrieved from the table.
